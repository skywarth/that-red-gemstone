- `!` allows for altering the value of the original object
  - `someArr.reverse()!` actually also reverses the someArr itself meanwhile returning the altered value
- `nil` value is absolute nothingness, not sure if its null or undefined yet. Probably `undefined`
- method calls doesn't require `()`, its optional. e.g: `imCallingSomeMethod;`
